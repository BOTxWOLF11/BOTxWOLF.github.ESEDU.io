    <h3>Gin Tama (銀魂, lit. "Silver Soul") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hideaki Sorachi. Set in Edo, which has been conquered by aliens named Amanto, the plot follows life from the point of view of samurai Gintoki Sakata, who works as a freelancer alongside his friends Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura to pay the monthly rent. Sorachi added the science fiction setting to develop characters to his liking after his editor suggested doing a historical series. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to September 2018, later in Jump GIGA from December 2018 to February 2019, and finished on the Gin Tama app in May and June 2019.</h3>
